It has enhanced our productivity, providing standardization and enabling faster iterations. At the core of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery are speed of delivery, reliability, and visibility. This process encourages frequent updates, allows quick fixes, and ensures a set of checks before deployment.</description></item><item><title>OWASP SAMM version 2 - public release</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2020/01/31/samm2-release/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2020/01/31/samm2-release/</guid><description>After three years of preparation, our SAMM project team has delivered version 2 of SAMM!

Over the last 10 years, it has proven a widely distributed and effective model for improving secure software practices in different types of organisations throughout the world. Translations and supporting tools have been contributed by the community to facilitate adoption and alignment. With version 2.0, we further improve the model to deal with some of its current limitations.</description></item><item><title>About us</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/about/</guid><description>What is OWASP SAMM? SAMM stands for Software Assurance Maturity Model.
Our mission is to provide an effective and measurable way for all types of organizations to analyze and improve their software security posture. We want to raise awareness and educate organizations on how to design, develop, and deploy secure software through our self-assessment model. SAMM supports the complete software lifecycle and is technology and process agnostic. We built SAMM to be evolutive and risk-driven in nature, as there is no single recipe that works for all organizations.</description></item><item><title>Acronyms and Abbreviations</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/acronyms-and-abbreviations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/acronyms-and-abbreviations/</guid><description> AA Architecture Assessment (SAMM Practice) ADFS Active Directory Federation Services ASVS OWASP Application Security Verification Standard AV Anti-Virus BOM Bill of Materials CBT Computer-Based Training CPE Common Platform Enumeration CVE Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures CVSS Common Vulnerability Scoring System CWE Common Weakness Enumeration DAST Dynamic Application Security Testing DDoS Distributed Denial of Service DevOps Integrated Development and Operations/dd DevSecOps Integrated Development, Security, and Operations/dd DM Defect Management (SAMM Practice) DOD Definition of Done DOR Definition of Ready DoS Denial of Service DSL Domain-Specific Language EM Environment Management (SAMM Practice) EG Education and Guidance (SAMM Practice) ESB Enterprise Service Bus GDPR General Data Protection Regulation (European Union law) HSM Hardware Security Module IAM Identity and Access Management IAST Interactive Application Security Testing IDE Integrated Development Environment IM Incident Management (SAMM Practice) IP Internet Protocol ISO International Standards Organization KPI Key Performance Indicator LDAP Lightweight Directory Access Protocol LMS Learning Management System NIST National Institute of Standards and Technology (US Agency) NVD National Vulnerability Database (US) OM Operational Management (SAMM Practice) OS Operating System OWASP Open Web Application Security Project PC Policy and Compliance (SAMM Practice) PCI Payment Card Industry PCI DSS Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard QA Quality Assurance RASP Runtime Application Self-Protection RCA Root Cause Analysis RT Requirements-driven Testing (SAMM Practice) REST REpresentational State Transfer SA Security Architecture (SAMM Practice) SAMM Software Assurance Maturity Model SAST Static Application Security Testing SB Secure Build (SAMM Practice) SD Secure Deployment (SAMM Practice) SDK Software Development Kit SDLC Software Development Life Cycle SIEM Security Information and Event Management SIP Session Initiation Protocol SLA Service Level Agreement SM Strategy and Metrics (SAMM Practice) SMART Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-bound SME Subject Matter Expert SOAP Simple Object Access Protocol SP Special Publication (NIST Document) SR Security Requirements (SAMM Practice) SSCE Secure Software Center of Excellence SSO Single Sign-On ST Security Testing (SAMM Practice) STRIDE Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, and Elevation of privilege SWIFT Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication TA Threat Assessment (SAMM Practice) TLS Transport Layer Security TPM Trusted Platform Module UAT User Acceptance Test VA Vulnerability Analysis VCS Version Control System WAF Web Application Firewall ZAP OWASP Zed Attack Proxy</description></item><item><title>Application Risk Profile</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/threat-assessment/stream-a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/threat-assessment/stream-a/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Architecture Assessment</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/verification/architecture-assessment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/verification/architecture-assessment/</guid><description>The Architecture Assessment (AA) practice ensures that the application and infrastructure architecture adequately meets all relevant security and compliance requirements, and sufficiently mitigates identified security threats. The first stream focuses on verifying that the security and compliance requirements identified in the Policy &amp;amp; Compliance and Security Requirements practices are met, first in an ad-hoc manner, then more systematically for each interface in the system.

One major theme for improvement across the Objectives is providing training for employees and increasing their security awareness, either through instructor-led sessions or computer-based modules.</description></item><item><title>Environment Management</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/operations/environment-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/operations/environment-management/</guid><description>The organization&amp;rsquo;s work on application security doesn&amp;rsquo;t end once the application becomes operational. New security features and patches are regularly released for the various elements of the technology stack you&amp;rsquo;re using, until they become obsolete or are no longer supported.
Most of the technologies in any application stack are not secure by default. This is frequently intentional, to enhance backwards compatibility or ease of setup. For this reason, ensuring the secure operation of the organization&amp;rsquo;s technology stack requires the consistent application of secure baseline configurations to all components.</description></item><item><title>Events and trainings</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/events/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/events/</guid><description>OWASP SAMM on tour OWASP SAMM 2: Your Dynamic Software Security Journey October 1st

In this model, we define a security incident as a breach, or the threat of an imminent breach, of at least one asset&amp;rsquo;s security goals, whether due to malicious or negligent behavior. Examples of security incidents might include: a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack against a cloud application, an application user accessing private data of another by abusing a security vulnerability, or an attacker modifying application source code.</description></item><item><title>Incident Response</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/operations/incident-management/stream-b/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/operations/incident-management/stream-b/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mapping SAMM 1.5 to 2.0</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/mapping-versions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/mapping-versions/</guid><description>Overview For those organizations using 1.0 or 1.5 versions of SAMM it&amp;rsquo;s important to take the time to understand how the framework has evolved.

Although these functions are not performed directly by an application, the overall security of the application and its data depends on their proper performance. Deploying an application on an unsupported operating system with unpatched vulnerabilities, or failing to store backup media securely, can make the protections built into that application irrelevant.
The functions covered by this practice include, but are not limited to: system provisioning, administration, and decommissioning; database provisioning and administration; and data backup, restore, and archival.</description></item><item><title>Operations</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/operations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/operations/</guid><description>The Operations Business Function encompasses those activities necessary to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability are maintained throughout the operational lifetime of an application and its associated data.

It does so by incrementally building a set of security test and regression cases and executing them regularly.
A key aspect of this practice is its attention to both positive and negative testing. The former verifies that the application&amp;rsquo;s security controls satisfy stated security requirements and validates their correct functioning.</description></item><item><title>SAMM Agile Guidance</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/guidance/agile/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/guidance/agile/</guid><description>Overview This document explains how SAMM security practices work for Agile to attain the continuous building in of sufficient security during software development. It&amp;rsquo;s structured in the form of best practices and pitfalls.

Self-assessment Your first step towards improvement, is to measure where you are now.
Make sure you first read our getting started guide, then you can start with assessing your current software assurance posture.</description></item><item><title>Scalable Baseline</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/verification/security-testing/stream-a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/verification/security-testing/stream-a/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Secret Management</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/implementation/secure-deployment/stream-b/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/implementation/secure-deployment/stream-b/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Secure Build</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/implementation/secure-build/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/implementation/secure-build/</guid><description>The Secure Build (SB) practice emphasises the importance of building software in a standardised, repeatable manner, and of doing so using secure components, including 3rd party software dependencies.
The first stream focuses on removing any subjectivity from the build process by striving for full automation. An automated build pipeline can include additional automated security checks such as SAST and DAST to gain further assurance and flag security regressions early by failing the build, for example.</description></item><item><title>Secure Deployment</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/implementation/secure-deployment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/implementation/secure-deployment/</guid><description>One of the final stages in delivering secure software is ensuring the security and integrity of developed applications are not compromised during deployment. The Secure Deployment (SD) practice focuses on this. To this end, the practice’s first stream focuses on removing manual error by automating the deployment process as much as possible, and making its success contingent upon the outcomes of integrated security verification checks. It also fosters Separation of Duties by making adequately trained, non-developers responsible for deployment.</description></item><item><title>Security Architecture</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-architecture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-architecture/</guid><description>The Security Architecture (SA) practice focuses on the security linked to components and technology you deal with during the architectural design of your software. Secure Architecture Design looks at the selection and composition of components that form the foundation of your solution, focusing on its security properties. Technology management looks at the security of supporting technologies used during development, deployment and operations, such as development stacks and tooling, deployment tooling, and operating systems and tooling.</description></item><item><title>Security Requirements</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-requirements/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-requirements/</guid><description>The Security Requirements (SR) practice focuses on security requirements that are important in the context of secure software. A first type deals with typical software-related requirements, to specify objectives and expectations to protect the service and data at the core of the application. A second type deals with requirements relative to supplier organizations that are part of the development context of the application, in particular for outsourced development. It is important to streamline the expectations in terms of secure development because outsourced development can have significant impact on the security of the application.</description></item><item><title>Security Testing</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/verification/security-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/verification/security-testing/</guid><description>The Security Testing (ST) practice leverages the fact that, while automated security testing is fast and scales well to numerous applications, in-depth testing based on good knowledge of an application and its business logic is often only possible via slower, manual expert security testing. Each stream therefore has one approach at its core.
The first stream focuses on establishing a common security baseline to automatically detect so-called &amp;ldquo;low hanging fruit&amp;rdquo;. Progressively customize the automated tests for each application and increase their frequency of execution to detect more bugs and regressions earlier, as close as possible to their inception.</description></item><item><title>Software Dependencies</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/implementation/secure-build/stream-b/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/implementation/secure-build/stream-b/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Software Requirements</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-requirements/stream-a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-requirements/stream-a/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Sponsors</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/sponsors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/sponsors/</guid><description>By sponsoring SAMM, you support a Flagship OWASP project.

Without an overall plan, you might be spending a lot of effort to build in security, while in fact your efforts may be unaligned, disproportional or even counterproductive. The goal of the Strategy &amp;amp; Metrics (SM) practice is to build an efficient and effective plan for realizing your software security objectives within your organization.
A software security program, that selects and prioritizes activities of the rest of the model, serves as the foundation for your efforts.</description></item><item><title>Supplier Security</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-requirements/stream-b/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-requirements/stream-b/</guid><description/></item><item><title>System Decomissioning / Legacy Management</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/operations/operational-management/stream-b/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/operations/operational-management/stream-b/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Technology Management</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-architecture/stream-b/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-architecture/stream-b/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Model</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/</guid><description>SAMM model overview Governance Design Implementation Verification Operations Strategy and Metrics Threat Assessment Secure Build Architecture Assessment Incident Management Policy and Compliance Security Requirements Secure Deployment Requirements-driven Testing Environment Management Education and Guidance Security Architecture Defect Management Security Testing Operational Management Introduction The mission of OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is to be the prime maturity model for software assurance that provides an effective and measurable way for all types of organizations to analyze and improve their software security posture.</description></item><item><title>Threat Assessment</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/threat-assessment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/threat-assessment/</guid><description>The Threat Assessment (TA) practice focuses on identifying and understanding of project-level risks based on the functionality of the software being developed and characteristics of the runtime environment. From details about threats and likely attacks against each project, the organization as a whole operates more effectively through better decisions about prioritization of initiatives for security. Additionally, decisions for risk acceptance are more informed, therefore better aligned to the business.
By starting with simple threat models and building application risk profiles, an organization improves over time.</description></item><item><title>Threat Modeling</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/threat-assessment/stream-b/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/threat-assessment/stream-b/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Training and Awareness</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/governance/education-and-guidance/stream-a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/governance/education-and-guidance/stream-a/</guid><description/></item><item><title>User day</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/agile-guidance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/agile-guidance/</guid><description/></item><item><title>User day</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/content-security-in-federated-media-cloud-workflows/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/content-security-in-federated-media-cloud-workflows/</guid><description/></item><item><title>User day</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/contributing-to-samm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/contributing-to-samm/</guid><description/></item><item><title>User day</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/integrating-samm-into-consulting-assessments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/integrating-samm-into-consulting-assessments/</guid><description/></item><item><title>User day</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/lean-security-in-devsecops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/lean-security-in-devsecops/</guid><description/></item><item><title>User day</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/owasp-categories-for-security-champions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/owasp-categories-for-security-champions/</guid><description/></item><item><title>User day</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/samm-benchmark/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/samm-benchmark/</guid><description/></item><item><title>User day</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/samm-dashboard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/samm-dashboard/</guid><description/></item><item><title>User day</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/samm-to-kickstart-the-tssdlc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/samm-to-kickstart-the-tssdlc/</guid><description/></item><item><title>User day</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/samm-tools-of-the-trade/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/samm-tools-of-the-trade/</guid><description/></item><item><title>User day</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/samm-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/samm-update/</guid><description/></item><item><title>User day</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/sins-of-samm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/sins-of-samm/</guid><description/></item><item><title>User day</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/user-day-wrap-up/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/user-day-wrap-up/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Verification</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/verification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/verification/</guid><description>Verification focuses on the processes and activities related to how an organization checks and tests artifacts produced throughout software development.
