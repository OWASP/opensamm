## Who is using OWASP SAMM?

We frequently get asked this question!

We know a lot of organizations are actually using SAMM to start and improve their Secure Development practices. We have a somewhat outdated list on the wiki (OpenSAMM Adopters - OWASP) but we would like to update this list and have it available here on our website.

If you are using SAMM, or you know of organizations that do, please provide us with a testimonial. Preferably, we would like to get a personal statement on how you used OWASP SAMM and how it benefitted you in your work.  
Please share it on our [Slack channel](https://owasp.slack.com/messages/C0VF1EJGH), or send it through our [contact form](/contact).

Thank you!
