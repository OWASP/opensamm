#The title of this activity
title: Security mechanisms are validated in a structured manner and confirmed for
  internal and external interfaces following a formalized method.

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: This activity validates the security mechanisms on the attack surface of
  the software and infrastructure architecture using formalized method and structured
  validation.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription: Validate the architecture security mechanisms

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Verify that the system design addresses each formally identified or informally known compliance requirement. For each interface in the application, formally iterate through the list of security and compliance requirements and analyze the architecture for their provision. Elaborate the analysis to show the design-level features that address each requirement. Consider both internal policy requirements and external regulatory ones.

  Perform this type of analysis on both internal interfaces, e.g. between tiers, as well as external ones, e.g. those comprising the attack surface and do so in a structured manner. Also identify and validate the high-risk design decisions made as part of the architecture. Finally, update the findings based on changes made during the development cycle, and note any compliance requirements that are not clearly provided at the design level as assessment findings.
