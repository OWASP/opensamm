#The title of this activity
title: Evaluate new and changing application architecture for mitigation of typical security threats

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: Assures that the architecture protects against typical security threats.

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription: Ad-hoc review of the architecture for unmitigated security threats.

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Review the architecture for typical security threats. Security-savvy technical staff conduct this analysis with input from architects, developers, managers, and business owners as needed, to ensure the architecture addresses all standard threats which development teams lacking specialised security expertise may have overlooked.

  Review each interface for adequate authorization and handling of credentials, and consider the confidentiality and integrity of data, in transit over communication channels and at rest in datastores. Partition the system users into anonymous, identified, authenticated, and privileged groups. Examine component stewardship by considering who provisions and maintains them, and what tracing, logging and audit facilities exist. When reviewing components, consider their relationships; How could an attacker leverage a compromised component to gain access to other parts of the system. Consider also how the system supports the detection, mitigation, or prevention of such attacks.

  Update the analysis during the design phase when there are changes in compliance requirements or high-level system design.
